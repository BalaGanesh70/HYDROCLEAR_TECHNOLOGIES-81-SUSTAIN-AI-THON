# Hydroclear Technologies

## Brief Introduction

32 aquatic organisms die every second, with 1,32,000 marine animals dying annually due to ocean pollution (NOAA, WWF). Global warming, rising sea levels, and increased CO2 levels exacerbate marine pollution. Despite increased awareness, no cost-effective, scalable solutions exist for removing oceanic plastic waste efficiently.

Hydroclear Technologies aims to innovate scalable drone technology to automate ocean plastic cleanup, addressing this critical environmental challenge. Our mission is to empower Earth's water with innovation, ensuring a sustainable future for marine ecosystems.
